# Socotitoare
The new |  rafined |  4 buttons and one rotatory thinghy that is the best for the everything. THe project was harder than I thought. I finished after 3 weeks of work |  and I thought it would take me like 2 days... Maybe if i wouldnt be switched so many CADs. KiCAD is the best program to use |  very intuitive |  very good |  very nice |  Romanian approved. :like:

# Why?
To be honest |  I like free stuff. I wanted to design my own things (secret project incoming). When I saw the "Blueprint" ideea |  I belived that is my moment |  and here we are.

# How to use
Plug usb C cable. The buttons will be adressable through input rempapper
