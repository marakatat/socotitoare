I hate every CAD app. From fusion, to onshape, to shapr3d. Maybe it is me, just maybe. Fusion has a bad UI/UX, same as Onshape (plus it is in browser). Shapr3d was the most promising giving a sleek UI. The UX was good.. initialy, but after trying to center two bodys, and searching for workarounds, this wasnt so good as I thought, plus the subscription was a pain in the ass, beucase without it you cannot visualise the model, which isnt the worst part. The worst part is that you cannot export the project. That app is just a free trial without any way to use it as a CAD without paying. But.. I stuck to it because of it "good" UI and clutterless design.
